  <string name="ChangelogV3.1">* Work around network issue in newer androids.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV3.0">* Migrated to gradle build system.\n* Updated to require android 3.2+ to hopefully fix some issues on newer devices.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.7">* Added feature information so as to be compatible with more devices.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.6">* Added permission RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED so newer (4.x?) androids can start BBG on boot.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.5">* Set correct content-type header on post. This only seems to appear on 3.0 or newer. Older android versions were unaffected.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.4">* Fixed issue where sending data to web server failed with newer android (2.3+).</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.3">* Quicker failover if GPS is disabled.\n* Connection errors are now logged on bottom of main screen instead of displaying a popup.\n* Main screen has been made scrollable so as to be usable with low-res devices.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.2">* Adapted for different screen sizes. Tested on Galaxy Tab.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.1">* Updated app so it can be moved to SD-card on android 2.2 devices\n* Sending of device id (IMEI/MEID) as \'deviceid=\' POST parameter.\n* Sending of subscriber id (IMSI) as \'subscriberid=\' POST parameter.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV2.0">* Fixed time zone on position date so it really is UTC.\n* Added options for sending/excluding most parameters from the HTTP request.\n* Added time of last fix to display.\n* Setting for coordinate format on display.\n* Added setting for continuous locator operation. This would give better accuracy and better response if you set update time to less than a few minutes, but will drain your battery faster.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.9">* Fixed date format.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.8">* Added \'provider\' HTTP parameter to inform server of which location provider provided the position\n* Added altitude (Parameter-name: altitude).\n* Added speed and bearing (parameter-names: speed, bearing).\n* Added time(parameter-name: time).\n* Option to allow HTTP response to be displayed in the notification bar instead of current position.\n* Renamed end program button.\n* Added button to trigger location update.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.7">* Doesn\'t neuter sheep anymore.\n* Added this changelog that you are reading right now.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.6">* Added battery state notification.\n* Added preferences setting to hide app from notification bar\n* Changed update interval to allow decimal numbers for those that wish to update more often than once a minute.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.5">* Added a \'secret\' parameter that (if set) will be sent to the server as part of the POST request.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.4">* Fixes a forgotten call to unregisterReceiver() on app shutdown. App is now marked as singleInstance, since it can\'t really run more than one instance anyway.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.3">* Fixes a GPS timeout problem where the service sometimes didn\'t switch locator from GPS to network on timeout.</string>
  <string name="ChangelogV1.0">* First version</string>
