* the app should test for network and battery before doing anything
  else. Network because it's useless to try and get a GPS position if
  you cannot send it. Battery because you don't want to spend your
  last percents of battery doing anything else than reading
  emails

* After getting a position, it should compare it with the last one,
  and doesn't send it if it differs less than, let say, half a
  kilometer. I know it would be easy to do that server-side, but if I
  can limit the connexion usage.

* If the position cannot be sent immediately, save it for the future.

* It would be good to have different profiles for if it
  is plugged in to the power or on batteries, that way it could update
  a lot more often if it was on external power.  We are using it on
  our motorbikes for keeping track of where we are. In this case it is
  on the bike and powered by the bike battery, so I set it to update
  once a minute, when it is off the bike I change it back to every 30
  minutes to save the phone battery.

* Time slots ? to get different update rates, for example. a time
  range with a higher update rate and a time slot during the night
  where it is not broadcasting the coordinates or only with at low
  fervency.
