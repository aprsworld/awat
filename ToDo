User requests:
* the app should test for network and battery before doing anything
  else. Network because it's useless to try and get a GPS position if
  you cannot send it. Battery because you don't want to spend your
  last percents of battery doing anything else than reading
  emails

* After getting a position, it should compare it with the last one,
  and doesn't send it if it differs less than, let say, half a
  kilometer. I know it would be easy to do that server-side, but if I
  can limit the connexion usage.

* If the position cannot be sent immediately, save it for the future.
